# Fishing Website Detection Project

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting phishing websites using machine learning techniques. Phishing websites are fraudulent websites that aim to steal sensitive information from users, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or personal information. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify websites as legitimate, suspicious, or phishing based on certain features.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a curated dataset containing features extracted from various websites. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features, such as URL length, presence of HTTPS, domain age, and more. The dataset is labeled with three classes: legitimate, suspicious, and phishing.

## Models

Four different machine learning models are employed for classification:

1. Random Forest
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Naive Bayes
4. Logistic Regression

Each model is trained on the dataset and evaluated based on its performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage

To run the project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fishing-website-detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Train and evaluate the machine learning models using the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts.

4. Experiment with different feature engineering techniques and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

## Results

The performance of each model is evaluated using various metrics, and the results are summarized in the project report. Additionally, visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves may be included to provide insights into model behavior.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in detecting phishing websites. By leveraging features extracted from website data, the models are able to classify websites with a high degree of accuracy. Future work may involve exploring additional features, experimenting with different algorithms, and deploying the model in real-world scenarios to combat online phishing attacks.
